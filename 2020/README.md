# Advent of Code 2020

My attempt at doing the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) challenges in C.

## How to run the code

All the code for day X is stored in the `day_X` directory. For each day there are multiple parts, each with their own `.c` and `.out` files.

To compile day X's code into an executable file, navigate to the directory `day_X` and run:

```bash
# For part 1
gcc -o part_1.out part_1.c

# For part 2
gcc -o part_2.out part_2.c
```

To run an executable file, navigate to the directory `day_X` and run:

```bash
# For part 1
./part_1.c

# For part 2
./part_2.c
```

# Advent of Code 2020

My attempt at doing the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) challenges in C.

## How to run the code

To compile day X's `solution.c` code into an executable `solution.out` file, navigate to the directory `day_X` and run:

```bash
gcc -o solution.out solution.c
```

To run an executable `solution.out` file, navigate to the directory `day_X` and run:

```bash
./solution.out
```
